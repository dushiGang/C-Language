----------------------------------------Logical Operators (!, &&, ||)-------------------------------------------

1.Logical NOT (!) 
2.Logical AND (&&) 
3.Logical OR (||)

1.****************************************Logical NOT (!)******************************************************

(a)It is also a unary operator.
(b)Priority of Logical NOT (!) operator is not only just higher than the remaining two logical operator but 
higher than all other operators too, as it is also a unary operator. 
(c)It inverts the truth value of statement.
(d)The behaviour of Logical NOT operator is to alter the truth value of the statement.
       ! TRUE =FALSE 
       ! FALSE =TRUE 
Example 1:
#include<stdio.h>
int main()
{
int x;
x=!(5>4);
printf("x=%d",x);
return 0;
}
Output:
The output of the program is  x=0 
In the expression x=!(5>4), bracket operates first, so the result of 5>4 is 1 (true). This result becomes 
the operand of logical NOT operator, which makes it 0 (false). Thus the value stored in x is 0.

Example 2:
#include<stdio.h>
int main()
{
int x;
x=!4;
printf("x=%d",x);
return 0;
}
Output:
The output of above program is  x=0 
In the expression x=!4, 4 is the operand of logical NOT operator. 4 is treated as true. Remember 
every non-zero value is true and zero is false. 4 is a non-zero value, so it is treated as true. Now 
logical NOT operator inverts the truth value from true to false and therefore 0 is stored in x. 

Example 3:
#include<stdio.h>
int main()
{
int y,x=5;
y=!x>4;
printf("x=%d",y);
return 0;
}
Output:
0

2.**************************************Logical AND operator (&&)***********************************************

(a)Logical AND operator is used to combine two expression, thus it is a binary operator. 
(b)The format of expression using && operator is : Expression1 && Expression2. 
(c)The behaviour of logical AND is describes as:
Expression 1                       Expression2                                 Result
TRUE                                  TRUE                                      TRUE
TRUE                                  FALSE                                     FALSE
FALSE                                 TRUE                                      FALSE
FALSE                                 FALSE                                     FALSE 
 
 Example 1:
#include<stdio.h>
int main()
{
int x;
x=5>3&&4<0;
printf("%d",x);
}
Output:
0
Here, two conditions 5>3 and 4<0 are combined to form a single condition using && operator as 5>3&&4<0. 
Condition one is evaluated as TRUE as 5 is greater than 3. Since condition one is TRUE 
condition two is tested and evaluated as FALSE as 4 is not less than 0. 
According to the above chart, T&&F is treated as FALSE thus 0 is stored in x.

Example 2:
#include<stdio.h>
int main()
{
int y,x=5;
y=x>4&&x<10;
printf("x=%d",y);
return 0;
}
Output:
1

3.*******************************************Logical OR (||)****************************************************

(a).Logical OR operator is also used to combine two expressions. This is a binary operator.
(b).The format of expression using || operator is : Expression1 || Expression2 
(c)The behaviour of logical OR operator is as follows: 
Expression 1                           Expression2                         Result
TRUE                                      TRUE                              TRUE
TRUE                                      FALSE                             TRUE
FALSE                                     TRUE                              TRUE
FALSE                                     FALSE                             FALSE
 
Example 1:
#include<stdio.h>
int main()
{
int x,y=5;
x=y>10||y<7;
printf("%d",x);
return 0;
}
Output:
1
In the expression x=y>10 ||y<7, y>10 is false, so we check expression 2 and y<7 is true, 
therefore operands of logical OR operator are false and true. The result is then evaluated as true, this result 
is assigned to variable x. Since true is represented as 1 (one) therefore x is assigned 1.
 
Example 2:
#include<stdio.h>
int main()
{
int y,x=5;
y=x<4||x<10;
printf("%d",y);
return 0;
}
Output:
1
