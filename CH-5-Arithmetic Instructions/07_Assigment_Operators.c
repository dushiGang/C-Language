-----------------------------Assignment Operator (= ,+=, -=, *=, /=, %=, &=,|=, ^=)-----------------------------

1.Assignment operator is the most used operator in the expression. 

2.It is sometimes misinterpreted as equal to operators by beginners.

3.Assignment operator is used to assign value to the variable. 

4.It is a binary operator where left operand must be a variable. 
For Example:
x=4; 
In this expression value 4 is assigned to the variable x.

5.Following are invalid expressions: 
4=x;                        //Left operand must be a variable.
3=4; 
a+3=5; 
  
6.Compound Assignment Operators(+=, -=, *=, /=, %=, &=, |=, ^=)

Example 1:
#include<stdio.h>
int main()
{
     int x=5;
      x+=4;            //Same as x=x+4
   printf("x=%d",x);
   return 0;
}
Output: 
x=9 
Expression x+=4 means, x is incremented by 4.  
Similarly,  
x-=3; is same as x=x-3; 
x*=5; is same as x=x*5; 
x/=7; is same as x=x/7; 
x%=3; is same as x=x%3; 
 
NOTE:
Do not interpret that the expression x*=2+5 can be simply replaced by x=x*2+5, because there is a 
difference in priority. To understand this concept observe the following two examples 
Example 2:
#include<stdio.h>
int main()
{
     int x=3;
      x*=2+5;            //Same as x=x+4
   printf("x=%d",x);
   return 0;
}
Output: 
x=21
In the expression x*=2+5; operator + has higher priority, thus resolved as x*=7, which further results 21.

Example 3:
#include<stdio.h>
int main()
{
     int x=3;
      x=x*2+5;           
   printf("x=%d",x);
   return 0;
}
Output: 
x=11
In the expression x=x*2+5; operator * has the highest priority, 
thus the expression is resolved as x=6+5, which is further evaluated as x=11.
