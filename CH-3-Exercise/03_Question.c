/*
Ques.3.What is the size of the float type variable?
Ans.The size of a float type variable in C is typically 4 bytes (32 bits). 
This is based on the IEEE 754 standard for single-precision floating-point representation, which most modern
systems follow.

******************************************Key Details About float*********************************************:
1.Memory Size= 4 bytes (32 bits).
2.Precision= About 6-7 significant decimal digits.

Ques.How to Check the Size of float?
We can use the sizeof operator in C to determine the size of a float on a specific system.

#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    printf("Size of float: %zu bytes\n", sizeof(float));
    return 0;
}
