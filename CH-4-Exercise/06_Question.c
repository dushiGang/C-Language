//Write a C program to print %d on the screen

#include <stdio.h>

int main() 
{
    printf("%%d");
    return 0;
}

/*

Explanation:
1.%%: In C, % is used as a format specifier. To print a literal %, we need to escape it by writing %%.

2.d: This is printed as a normal character since it follows the escaped %.

3.printf("%%d");: Prints %d literally on the screen.
